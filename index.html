                        Objective: To analyze and detect disease from the scans and reports of patients thereby suggesting the required       treatment.
•	Description: A research project focused on developing an automated system for detecting pulmonary embolism from CTPA (Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography) images.
•	Implemented advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze CTPA images and identify potential signs of pulmonary embolism.
•	Collaborated with a team of 3 to collect, preprocess, and curate a diverse dataset of CTPA images for training and validation.
•	Employed state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to achieve accurate and reliable detection results.
•	Conducted extensive experimentation and fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance, achieving [mention accuracy, precision, or other metrics] on the test dataset.
•	Utilized Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for the implementation and evaluation of the model.
•	Presented the research findings to internal team presentation, Head of the department as well as an external team, receiving positive feedback on the potential clinical impact of the project.
•	Demonstrated strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills in addressing challenges related to image quality, noise reduction, and class imbalance.
•	This project deals with a detailed study to suggest an appropriate treatment by analyzing the scans  and reports of the patient.
•	It presents a multi- stage CNN for automated detection of PE from CTPA images. The first stage detects the suspected PE and the second stage is used to eliminate false positives.
Technologies used: Advanced image processing techniques, machine learning algorithms (including CNNs), Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.
